Hi , Hope you are doing well. Let me give my brief into. 

Fahim here DevOps guy. i have 5 + year of experience in devops and from last 1 year I'm working with Tkxel.

I also have Associate Level Certification of     solutions architect 

I have some extensive experience with  multiple tools of devops. Like CI/CD pipelines for deployments , 
Docker, kuberentes for micro services and orchisteration, Ansible and terrform for IAC and graylogs, 
promethous for monitoring and some multiple  AWS services. 
In my routine task 
i am working on AWS services, managing multiple EC2 instances, codepipeline EKS and EECS clusters of multiple envs, S3, route53, cloudfronnt, RDS DBs etc. 
and also giving support to developer in the troubleshooting things. 


What is you biggest achievement?
Sure, i did automate all the manually deployment using Gitlab_ci jenkins and github action. 
It was the biggest achivement becasue before this client was struggling to get the updated vesion of 
their app and their was also no records for code commit. So what i did i made the CI/CD pipeline which 
controlled the build so if there was any issue in code then build should not be passed this way we can verfiy the error as well i also used lint for error tracking
